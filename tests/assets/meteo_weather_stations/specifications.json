  "description": "The dataset includes daily meteorological parameters for the period 2010-2023 from 54 meteorological stations. You can see visualizations of the data from these stations on the page https://www.meteo.gr/climate/ The parameters are temperature (\u00b0C), relative humidity (%), pressure (hPa), rainfall (mm), wind speed (km/h), dominant wind direction, and wind gust (km/h). The measurements come from the network of automatic meteorological stations of the National Observatory of Athens/meteo.gr. Information about the stations and any malfunctions are provided at http://meteosearch.meteo.gr/ on the respective station's page. Reference to the network is made through the scientific publication https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/gdj3.44",
