# Profile Examples

This section provides examples of dataset profiles generated by the Dataset Profiler service for different types of datasets.

The profiles are in JSON-LD format and extend the [Croissant Metadata Schema](https://mlcommons.org/working-groups/data/croissant/).

!!! note
    As the Dataset Profiler service is under active development, the examples provided here are illustrative and may not represent the full capabilities of the service. Future versions may include additional features and improvements.
